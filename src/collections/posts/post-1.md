Hi, I am Juan Vertiz, a computer systems engineer from Mexico. I like electronic music and palindromes. In fact, my favorite palindrome in Spanish is _"La ruta nos aportÃ³ otro paso natural"_, which I interpret as _"Life will always give you more opportunities"_. It sounds way more poetic in Spanish.

I started my professional career as a test automation engineer three years ago. My first job was at NEORIS, then I worked for another company called P\S\L Group, and I recently started a new position at EPAM Systems. That's funny because NEORIS is now part of EPAM Systems, and maybe that counts as a spiritual return to my first company.

Test automation is a cool career. You get to code a bit while helping keep quality in software products. However, I've always wanted to be a backend developer since I finished college but my decisions brought me to where I am right now. I've been _planning_ to change my career path for the past year, but I haven't taken any action on this plan.

I kinda need to expose myself to feel committed, so I tought of creating this blog to document my progress toward becoming a **real** backend developer. I also think it's a good way to polish my poor frontend development abilities.

I will post in the [Blog](/blog) section about interesting stuff I learn, and eventually add the resulting projects in the [Projects](/projects) section as well.

Don't blink, or you might miss it. ðŸ˜‰
